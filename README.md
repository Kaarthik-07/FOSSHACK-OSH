# Problem Statement

Many developers, particularly beginners, struggle with finding the right open-source projects to contribute to. Common issues include:
Difficulty in discovering beginner-friendly projects
Lack of proper guidance on how to contribute
Unclear or missing contribution paths
Unwelcoming or toxic community discussions
These challenges discourage new contributors and make it harder for them to engage with the open-source ecosystem 

# Approach
To address these issues, OpenSource Hub acts as a curated platform that simplifies open-source contributions by:

Curating beginner-friendly projects 
– Listing projects that are welcoming to new contributors, categorized by difficulty, tech stack, and community support.
Providing clear contribution guidelines 
– Ensuring that each listed project includes well-documented steps on how to contribute, making it easier for beginners to get started.
Fostering a toxicity-free environment 
– Encouraging collaborative discussions, implementing moderation mechanisms, and providing a safe space for developers to ask questions and get feedback without fear of toxicity.

# Working
   Open source allows developers to freely access, modify, and share software code. Contributors collaborate on platforms like GitHub, submitting improvements for review. This model fosters transparency, rapid innovation, and community-driven development. By combining global expertise, open source projects evolve quickly, benefiting from shared knowledge and diverse perspectives.

# Knowledge Base Creation
   ## **1. Collaboration**  
   - **Global Talent Pool**: Open source invites contributions from developers around the world, bringing diverse skills, perspectives, and creativity to the project. This broad participation speeds up development and brings innovative solutions to complex problems.
   - **Community Support**: Open-source projects foster strong communities where members help each other, share knowledge, and contribute resources, making the software more resilient and accessible to users of all levels.

# Use Case
Here are some potential use cases for fetching data from a previous feed in an open-source hub:

- **Project Updates**: Display recent changes, pull requests, or issues from a project's repository feed to keep contributors informed.
- **Contributors’ Activity**: Show recent activities by contributors, such as new pull requests, issue comments, or merges, to recognize community engagement.
- **Trending Projects**: Fetch data from popular repositories or discussions to highlight trending open-source projects based on activity or community interest.
- **Toxicity Free Community**: We offer a toxicity-free platform in the OpenSource Hub community, fostering collaboration, respect, and inclusivity for all developers.
- **User Contributions**: Pull a user's recent contributions across repositories and display them as part of their open-source portfolio.
- **Repository Suggestions**: Offer repository recommendations based on previous user activities or similar projects.
- **Discussion Summaries**: Show recent discussions or important conversations from issues or pull requests that are relevant to the community.

These use cases enhance interaction and engagement within the open-source ecosystem.Here are some potential use cases for fetching data from a previous feed in an open-source hub:

# Technologies Used

1. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: A suite of cloud computing services that provides scalable infrastructure, storage, machine learning tools, and databases, helping developers build, deploy, and manage applications with ease and flexibility.

2. **Celedon (Toxicity Checker)**: A machine learning model used for detecting toxic comments and content in online platforms, ensuring the safety of interactions by filtering harmful language and maintaining a positive environment.

3. **Next.js (Frontend)**: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated websites, with features like routing, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance, offering a seamless developer experience.

4. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by providing a collection of pre-defined classes, allowing developers to style elements directly in HTML without writing custom CSS.

5. **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity by catching errors at compile time rather than runtime.

6. **Flask (Backend)**: A lightweight Python web framework for building web applications. It’s simple, flexible, and provides tools to create RESTful APIs or dynamic websites with minimal overhead.

7. **Node.js & Express (Backend)**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable applications, while Express is a minimal web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware handling, and request processing.

8. **Node.js WebSocket (Backend)**: A protocol that enables two-way communication between a server and clients, ideal for real-time applications like chat rooms or live updates, by maintaining a persistent connection.

9. **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative offering a suite of tools like authentication, real-time databases, and file storage, making it easier to build and scale full-stack applications.

10. **AWS S3 (Storage Bucket)**: A scalable object storage service from Amazon Web Services that allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data, such as images, videos, and backups, with high durability.

11. **UploadThing**: A file uploading service that simplifies handling file uploads in web applications, managing storage, and handling metadata, making it easy to integrate into cloud-based storage solutions like AWS S3.
